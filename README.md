# Features:
- Do /rcpvehicles in the RedM chat to open the menu
- Click the X or press Escape to close
- Toggling the Blue Switch in the top right changes whether only 1 button gets highlighted when clicked or any of them
- Clicking the menu title resets the buttons back to their red colour
- The selectors at the top allow you to customise the CreateVehicle code before spawning it
- Clicking a button in the menu selects the vehicle then pressing "Use CreateVehicle" or "Use CreateVehicle_2" will spawn it
# Installation:
1. Make a folder called rcpvehicles in your resources folder of your server (it has to be lower case)
2. Clone or download the files to that folder
3. Put start rcpvehicles in the server.cfg, it is case sensitive so make sure it's the exact same as the folder name
# Issues/Bugs &amp; New Features:
If you find a bug, issue or error or if you want to request a new feature, [create an issue](https://github.com/RCPisAwesome/RedMRCPVehicles/issues) with as much information as you can provide

If you ever get stuck in the menu from an issue you can do rcpuifix in the F8 console to close it if you have my Settings Menu installed

Trains do not work as actual trains it just spawns the model. There will be an update when trains have been worked out.

If your menu doesn't look like the screenshots (click on them to make sure its the latest image), delete your RedM cache except the game folder and your server cache too
